<p dir="auto">I am quite anxious about which career path should I choose in AI CV NLP or Robotics as a master degree graduate in Computer Science program. I went to consulting office at school and also consult with
people online. Some of the feedback I got are listed here:</p>
<p dir="auto">You understand the various directions of computers too much. I have misunderstood these three areas too little. If you are in the field of computer science, these three directions are not much different, they are all branches of artificial intelligence. Most likely, your teacher will give you any topic they happen to have. If your teacher has all three topics, just choose one with your eyes closed because there isn't much difference.</p>
<p dir="auto">Computers are just a few things, basically versatile. If you excel in any direction, the job market will assume that you don't need too much effort to switch to the other two directions. In fact, the recruitment market is likely to view you as an ordinary programmer, and the direction you learn is not important. My brother is studying artificial intelligence and his thesis is in artificial intelligence. He has been working in IT architecture for decades, and jobs were much easier to find back then than they are now. To be frank, no matter how much AI you learn, it would be great to find a good job as a code farmer in the current market. As for whether it is the direction you are studying, it is highly likely that you cannot even find a job related to AI. The job market relies on luck, luck does not choose the direction. If these three directions are placed in different major categories, such as robotics, which has different focuses in both mechanical and electronic categories; CV has also been studied in the field of biology, with different focuses; NLP is more likely to have a better focus in language theory majors.</p>
<p dir="auto">CMU's School of Computer Science has directly hired two purely linguistic professors to establish a language based artificial intelligence major. For these two professors, artificial intelligence is only a tool for them to implement their ideas, and their true research direction is language. Most likely, you do not have the latter problem, as you cannot face choices across so many majors such as mechanics, electronics, computer science, biology, and language. Most likely, you are in the field of computer science. In this case, the first choice is to choose a supervisor. For the master's stage, it is more important to choose a supervisor who is easy to mix up with. Unless you can choose a mentor who can directly help you find a job, choosing one is easy. During graduate studies, take on multiple part-time jobs and gain an understanding of society. Under the premise of selecting a mentor (regardless of whether you have chosen a suitable mentor or not), choose a topic that is easy to complete. Most doctoral supervisors in schools, if they also have master's students, are likely to have no time to deal with you. Just find a PhD or a new teacher in the teaching and research department to let you follow along. In this situation, we must find someone better. Ordinary master's supervisors simply do not have good topics for you. As for whether you can use your discerning eye to find a potential doctoral or master's supervisor or research project, it is highly likely that at your age, you do not have the technical ability or insight into human nature. Give up, the most important thing is to pass easily, and the rest is more reliable.</p>
